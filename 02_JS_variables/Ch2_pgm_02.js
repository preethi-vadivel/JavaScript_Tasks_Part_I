 * Console Interactions:
 * 
 * > score          // Typing the variable name displays its current value
 * > 100            // Output: The initial value of 'score is 100
 * 
 * > score = 200    // Reassigning a new value to 'score'
 * > 200            // Output: The value of 'score' is now 200
 * 
 * > score = 300    // Reassigning another value to 'score'
 * > 300            // Output: The value of 'score' is now 300
 *
 * 
 * Explanation:
 *   Each time you reassign the 'score' variable, the new value 
 *   replaces the previous one. Typing 'score' in the console after
 *   each assignment reflects this change.
